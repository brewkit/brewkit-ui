# Forms

Forms are generally comprised of three components:

1. `<Form />` - Wraps the form's fields and determines what to do when the form is submitted.
2. `<FormField />` - Renders an input field and binds it to the `Form`. Also handles input validation.
3. `<FormSubmit />` - The submit button usually at the end of a form. Will lock and unlock based on validity of the inputs.

For better usage examples, check out the [documentation on Form](/?path=/docs/forms-form--general).

## Validation

The preferred way of validating a `Form` is using [yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup) validation schema. The validation schema
is handed off to `Form` using the `validationSchema` prop.


```jsx
const validationSchema = yup.object({
    myField: yup.string().required('This field is required.').min(10, 'A length of 10 or more is required.'),
});


<Form validationSchema={validationSchema}>
    <FormField label="Required TextField" name="myField" />
    <FormSubmit />
</Form>
```
